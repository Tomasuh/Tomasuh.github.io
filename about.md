Names Axel and I’m a security interested student living in Gothenburg, Sweden and currently studying Computer science at University of Gothenburg.

I'm trying to further my knowledge of analysing compiled code in the manner of analyzing malware, write exploits, reading code and writing shellcode et cetera.
My hopes are to pursue a carrier in the field. 

In this blog I will post good to have scripts, exploits I find and lots of other stuff you won’t need!
