[The Threat Matrix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10684169-the-threat-matrix) 
written by Garrett M. Graff is a comprehensive summary of the FBI history in regards to the War on Terror.

The era described is primarily when Robert Mueller were director.

This book is one of the best books I have read in the genre and in general for a long time.
The author has heavily researched the subject including a large amount of interviews.
This is clearly noticed when reading the book.

It's an intense action-full read that never gets boring while still providing the reader with plentiful detail how
 the way FBI fights terrorism has evolved throughout history.

Highlight of the book for me were the part where interrogation methods were discussed which were used after 9/11 with the clash between CIA's and FBI's way of doing things.

Highly recommended read, a dense book well worth the time.
