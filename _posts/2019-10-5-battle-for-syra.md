After finishing the book [The Battle For Syria: International Rivalry In The New Middle East](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29434922-the-battle-for-syria) written by [Steve Coll](https://twitter.com/stevecollny) written **Christopher Phillips** I will here provide some comments on the book.

The purpose of the book is to portray the involvement of external organisations and counties in the Syrian civil war.
This purpose is fulfilled in a compact format of 262 pages with an extensive appendix with references used as basis for the chapters.

The writing is on-point and the chapters has subsections making the content easy to grasp.

This is a great book for anyone wanting to understand the reasoning behind external actors involded in the civil war and in turn have a better understanding of upcoming events in the conflict.
