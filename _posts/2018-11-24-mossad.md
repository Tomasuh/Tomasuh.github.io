After finishing two quite different books on the history of the Israeli intelligence agency 
Mossad I will provide my impressions of the books and outline their differences and strengths.

## Mossad: The Great Operations of Israel's Secret Service

[Mossad: The Great Operations of Israel's Secret Service](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mossad-Operations-Israels-Secret-Service/dp/1849549397) is written by the authors [Michael Bar-Zohar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bar-Zohar) and [Nissim Mishal](https://www.harpercollins.com/author/cr-105735/nissim-mishal/).
The book explains the most famous Mossad operations since it's beginning with 
each chapter explaining an impressive operation.
The goal from the authors seems to be to provide the reader with an enjoyable
 read rather than a deep understanding of how Mossad operates and the politics 
behind it.

The book do provide an enjoyable introduction to one of the worlds most 
pro-active spy-agency but neutrality of the authors cannot be expected 
and its almost only the good parts of the agencies history that has been
 put into writing.

## Rise and Kill First - The secret history of Israels targeted assasinations

The book [Rise and 
Kill First - The secret history of Israels targeted assasinations](https://ronenbergman.com/rise-and-kill-first-the-book/)
 written by [Ronen Bergman](https://ronenbergman.com/biography/) provides an extensive explanation 
 on how the Intelligence agencies in Israel has evolved since their creation and examines 
 past operations with a strong focus on the targeted assasinations towards members of 
 organisations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, PLA and PLF.

The large amount of research shows similarities with the book [The Threat Matrix](http://tomasuh.github.io/2018/01/21/Threat-matrix.html) in the most complimentary way.
While the tone in the book is very objective one gets the feeling that the author 
believes that the amount of targeted killings and how they are approached is the 
wrong way to resolve conflicts in the region long term.

This book provides a fantastic explanation on the history of Mossad and the conflicts 
the organisation and the state Israel has faced in the past and how they were approached.

## Which one to read?

If you want to have an exciting read about one of the worlds most impressive intelligency agency 
go for [Mossad: The Great Operations of Israel's Secret Service](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mossad-Operations-Israels-Secret-Service/dp/1849549397) but then finish of with [Rise and Kill First](https://ronenbergman.com/rise-and-kill-first-the-book/) 
to gain a wider more balanced view.
