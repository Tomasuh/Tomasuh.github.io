Want a standalone pattern create or offset lookup script aka pattern\_create.rb and pattern\_offset.rb in metasploit?
You're at the right place!

There are lots of alternative scripts, and mostly the decent ones are integrated in other software, such as:

*	[mona.py](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2011/07/14/mona-py-the-manual/)
*	[peda](https://github.com/zachriggle/peda)
*	[metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/)
*	[...](http://www.google.se/)

There are also standalone scripts made but the ones I've come over are either to hackish made, too unclear how they work or the functions offered are simply not enough.

Examples:

*	[Recreating pattern_create.rb in python!](https://www.phillips321.co.uk/2013/04/02/recreating-pattern_create-rb-in-python/)
*	[exploitPattern.py](https://github.com/eugeneching/exploit-pattern/blob/master/exploitPattern.py)
*	[Unique Pattern Generator for Exploit Development](https://securitythoughts.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/tool-unique-pattern-generator-for-exploit-development/)
*	[...](http://www.google.se/)


So how's my script better? Up to you.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/Tomasuh/various/blob/master/pattern.py).

Usage:

Example commands and their output:

Pretty straightforward usage, open an issue at [github](https://github.com/Tomasuh/various) if you find any problems.
Improvements are also welcome.
