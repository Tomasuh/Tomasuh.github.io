So writing an anti-virus in python, good idea? For performance, no, but for the fun and learning more about identifying malware sure!

For those of you who haven’t explored the python libraries pefile and psutil I strongly suggest you to do so. They’re both fantastic with great functionalities. And as they both have a great role to play in the AV I will start of with showing some of their good to know functions.
Pefile can be used as the names suggests in reading the pe-format, and as a beginner in the pe world, I found pefile to be a great tool to explore files with.

```python
print "yo"
```
