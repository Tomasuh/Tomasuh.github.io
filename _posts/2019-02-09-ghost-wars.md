The book [Ghost Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Wars) written by [Steve Coll](https://twitter.com/stevecollny) 
explains the conflict inside of Afghanistan starting from the overthrow of the soviet supported regime all the way to 
the day before 9/11. It has a main focus on how American policy in Afghanistan implemented by CIA has affected the country.
 Actions taken by other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Soviet, Iran, Pakistan is also discussed.

Natrually included is information on specific groups and/or commanders that has acted inside of Afghanistan during
 that period, such as for example the Taliban, Al-Quida, Ahmad Shah Massoud.

The book is easy to read and provides a capturing telling on how the Afghan conflict has evolved. I found it awesome to read!
