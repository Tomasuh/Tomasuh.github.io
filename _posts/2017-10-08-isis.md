The book ["Hacking ISIS: How to Destroy the Cyber Jihad"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31213211-hacking-isis) written by the two terrorist experts Malcolm Nance and Christopher Sampson is written to give an insight how ISIS operates over the internet domain in regards to actions such as recruiting, media-propaganda and hacking.

The content of the book largely revolves around how ISIS recruit, communicate, 
create and spread propaganda which the title of the book does not reflect.
Their offensive it-security operations are also discussed with the conclusion 
that their level of competence is low and uncordinated.

There are also some content regarding anti-ISIS cyber operations, 
the limited insight the authors have of state operations towards 
the group makes this part of the book somewhat thin and uninteresting.

If you want a summary of the precense of ISIS on the internet this book is an informative 
read.
